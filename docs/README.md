# What is WPLytic?

**WPLytic** is a self-hosted **WordPress Analytics Plugin**.

### What does "self-hosted analytics" mean?

Compared to hosted or cloud analytics, WPLytic is entirely **self-hosted.** This means that all your **visitor stats are stored locally**, in your existing WordPress MySQL database. This means that no visitors data is shared with other companies (like Google Analytics) and no 3rd party trackers and resources are loaded on your website.

Using self-hosted analytics, it is a lot easier to respect the ever-changing **privacy and cookies laws** like **GDPR** or **CCPA**.
