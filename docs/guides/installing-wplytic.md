:::info
**Note:** For security, flexibility and performance reasons, WPLytic uses its own users system, separated from the WordPress users system. You can also access the WPLytic dashboard directly without going through wp-admin or having access to it.\
\
All logged in WordPress users with **Administrator** role will have an admin WPLytic accont automatically created for them when accessing the dashboard.
